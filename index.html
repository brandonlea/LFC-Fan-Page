                            Inside the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, the Reds' fairy-tale 2004-05 run to the Champions
                            League
                            final under Rafael Benitez had begun to turn into a nightmare.

                            They trailed to AC Milan within a matter of seconds, Paolo Maldini meeting a free-kick into
                            the
                            middle from the right flank with a strike that thudded into the ground and back up into
                            Jerzy
                            Dudek's net.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            By half-time, the deficit was three, Hernan Crespo having twice more found the target for a
                            vintage Milan side of Andrea Pirlo, Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko et al.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            A frantic interval featured reshuffles of personnel and tactics inside the dressing room as
                            Liverpool – soothed and inspired by You'll Never Walk Alone from the stands – sought to stem
                            the
                            tide and preserve dignity.
                        </span>

                        <span>Nobody could have predicted what followed.</span>

                        <span>
                            Fifteen minutes after the restart, the score was 3-3, a sublime Steven Gerrard header
                            preceding
                            a Vladimir Smicer strike and a Xabi Alonso penalty converted at the second attempt.
                        </span>

                        <span>A miraculous comeback was complete.</span>

                        <span>
                            Still, they needed a sensational, scarcely-believable double save from Dudek to keep out
                            Shevchenko and force a penalty shootout, during which the goalkeeper's 'spaghetti legs'
                            routine
                            helped the Reds triumph and get their hands on the European Cup for the fifth time.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            "At half-time we thought we were going to be losers," said Gerrard. "To come back and score
                            three goals against possibly one of the best sides in Europe, credit to the boys and we're
                            just
                            really happy."

                        <span>
                            On April 15, 1989, during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at
                            Hillsborough Stadium, a tragic event occurred that would change football forever.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            What should have been a day of celebration turned into one of the darkest days in football
                            history, as 97 Liverpool supporters lost their lives due to overcrowding in the Leppings
                            Lane end of the stadium.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            The disaster led to the Taylor Report, which transformed stadium safety across England,
                            including the removal of perimeter fencing and the introduction of all-seater stadiums.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            For decades, the families of the victims fought tirelessly for truth and justice, facing
                            numerous obstacles. Their perseverance led to the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel report
                            and new inquests that finally recognized the fans were not to blame.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Today, the Hillsborough Memorial at Anfield stands as a permanent reminder of those who lost
                            their lives. The disaster has shaped the club's identity and strengthened the bond between
                            Liverpool FC and its supporters.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            The annual memorial service at Anfield continues to honor the 97, and the club's motto
                            "You'll Never Walk Alone" took on even deeper meaning, symbolizing the unity and strength of
                            the Liverpool family.

                    <p>
                        Liverpool Football Club was founded on June 3, 1892, following a dispute between Everton FC and
                        John Houlding, the owner of Anfield. Houlding formed a new club to play at Anfield, and
                        Liverpool FC was born.

                            Bill Shankly's arrival in 1959 transformed the club. He rebuilt the team, won three league
                            titles, two FA Cups, and the UEFA Cup, establishing Liverpool as a European powerhouse.
