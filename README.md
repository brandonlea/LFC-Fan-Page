[Tablet Wireframe](docs/wireframes/Tablet.png "Tablet Wireframe")

[Desktop Wireframe](docs/wireframes/Desktop.png "Desktop Wireframe")

## Designs

I have chosen these colors and font because it matches the Liverpool FC color scheme.

## Typography

The font family I have choosen is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato, "Lato") because it makes it feel modern while matching the theme.

## Testing

### Bugs
I made sure to test each section when I was adding it and after everything was done so I could make sure there was no issues.
| Bug                                      | Status | Description                                                                           | Steps To Resolve                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Performance was low due to images sizes. | Fixed  | Images was too big and causing to load slower.                                        | I compressed the images and used loading="lazy" on the images to fix this issue.                                                     |
| Website Responsive.                      | Fixed  | I took a different approach to make the website more responsive and use less code.    | I made reusable classes and used mobile first so I only had to use 1 media query for laptop and bigger.                              |
| Form Validation and sending email.       | Fixed  | The form wasn't working with mailto so I had to use a 3rd party system to send email. | I fixed this by using a 3rd party system called [https://formsubmit.co/](https://formsubmit.co/)Â which works way better and simpler. |

### Responsiveness Tests
To test responsiveness I made sure to use mobile first approach and kept testing it using developer tools then after it was done I used [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) to make sure it worked on multiple devices.

[Back to the Top](#contents)

When I was developing the website I was using Google Chromes Mobile Simulator to make sure it was working correctly and I have made it responsive by aligning each section and allowing the text and images to shirk to able to see and fit correctly.
